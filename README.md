This repository contains tweets from users congratulating Trump on winning the 
2016 presidential election. You can read more about why I did this [here].

To work with the tweet data you'll need to turn the tweet identifiers back into
Twitter JSON data. The Makefile will do this for you but you'll need to install
[Python] and [twarc] first. You'll also need to get your [Twitter API] keys
and set them in your environment.

    pip install twarc
    Make
